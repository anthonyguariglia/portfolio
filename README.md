# Personal Software Portfolio

## Because templates are over rated!

Designed using React, this website is a portfolio piece in itself! As my time at General Assembly has waned, I chose to apply the new front-end techniques I have learned to design a modern, responsive representation of my work.

I wanted to design something interactive, and something that at a glance looked like it was done professionally, without spending weeks on it. React offered a great way to do this, creating components for the major visual blocks and using the React-Bootstrap library for some of the more dynamic elements.

This website organizes each major visual block as a React component, and uses Modals for all of the pop-up display features. Additional styling is done in SCSS to add some flavor to the site. The finished product is a simple yet organized representation of my front-end skills, and of my creative design side as a whole.

Of course there is always room for improvement, so if you have any suggestions, please send me an email at aguariglia197@gmail.com. Any and all feedback is appreciated!
