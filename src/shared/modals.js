              SpotiFeed provides a way for Spotify users to see the recent uploads of their followed artists in a news-feed style display. Once signed in, the app allows the user to log into their Spotify account and then pulls their followed artists, finds their most recent singles and albums, and displays them in descending chronological order.

              Once the most recent tracks have been pulled, the user is able to create their own playlists to store their favorite tracks. They can name their playlists as they like, add and remove songs and albums as they please, and their playlists will remain unchanged as their recent uploads evolve over time.

              Note: Because SpotiFeed is still an app in development, each Spotify user&apos;s email must be registered before use. To get around this, I&apos;ve created a &apos;dummy&apos; Spotify account that can be used for testing, or you can reach out and I&apos;ll add your email to the list! Shoot me a message via the &apos;Contact&apos; section to learn more.

            I wanted to design something interactive, and something that at a glance looked like it was done professionally, without spending weeks on it. React offered a great way to do this, creating components for the major visual blocks and using the React-Bootstrap library for some of the more dynamic elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website organizes each major visual block as a React component, and uses Modals for all of the pop-up display features. Additional styling is done in SCSS to add some flavor to the site. The finished product is a simple yet organized representation of my front-end skills, and of my creative design side as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course there is always room for improvement, so if you have any suggestions, please drop me a message in the contact section below. Any and all feedback is appreciated!

            While more technically advanced than anything I had done prior, the real challenge of this application was that it was done in a group of 5 students. As a group, we had 4 days to complete this project and all had to assign ourselves tasks to reach completion on time
          </p>
          <p>
            Having some prior experience using the Agile Scrum methodology, I took on the role of Scrum Master for this group. I handled all processes related to managing tickets, creating and merging pull requests, resolving conflicts, and merging feature branches to both the development and main branches. Additionally, I took on issues spanning both the front and back end, and pushed out a significant number of features alongside my Scrum duties
          </p>
          <p>
            To assist with the Scrum operations, a Kanban board was created using GitHub&apos;s &apos;projects&apos; tab feature. This allowed each of our team members to create issues for tasks that needed to be resolved, and for the group to track those issues through to completion. Relevant PRs were attached to each issue, and they were moved along from their respective repos (front or back end), to &apos;in progress&apos;, &apos;in review&apos;, and finally &apos;closed&apos;.

            BankRoll is a simple stock-tracking app that allows users to add and follow the performance of their stocks in one place. Once an account is created, the user can search for any stock registered on the major exchanges using the built-in search bar, and see a graph of the stock&apos;s recent performance over ranges of 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month.

            If the user wishes to track this stock for an extended period of time, they have the option of creating a stock list with their desired name, and can add as many stocks as they would like to this list. Each stock they add will appear in the stock bar at the top of the screen, and the current stock price and daily percent change will update for those stocks upon every data refresh. If they no longer wish to track the stock, they can simply click the X at the top right corner of the stock on the stock bar and it will be removed.
